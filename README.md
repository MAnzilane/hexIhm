Hex Game Project
================

This project was assigned to the second year Computer Science students of Universit√© Paul Sabatier. The task was to implement the Hex Game (a strategy board game played between two players on a hexagonal grid). The game was to be implemented in C (for the calculations) and in Java (for the interface). All the documents to turn in for the project are in the doc directory.

Our implementation includes the following functionnalities:
* Choose the board size
* Choose the player who will play first
* Blocks illegal moves
* Manages each player's turn
* Detects a winner
* Allows the players to quit with or without saving their game
* Manages the history of previously saved games
* Undo a move
* Save a game, restore a game, forfeit a game

Compilation Instructions
------------------------
In the `InterfaceAvecC.java` file in the ProjetS4BEGGIFOUDINEMMADI/code/codeJava/ directory, the library path must be modified. Thus the library must be generated according to your operationg system.

To generate the library change your working directory to ProjetS4BEGGIFOUDINEMMADI/lib/ and execute the following commands

#### For Linux:
```
$ gcc -I/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_01/include/
      -I/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_01/include/linux -c -fPIC InterfaceAvecC.c
$ gcc -shared -o libInterfaceAvecC.so InterfaceAvecC.o
```

#### For Mac:
```
$ gcc -I/Library/Java/Home/include/
      -I/Library/Java/Home/include/darwin -c InterfaceAvecC.c
$ gcc -shared -o libInterfaceAvecC.dylib InterfaceAvecC.o
```

#### For Windows
```
$ gcc -c -I"C:\j2sdk1.4.2_02\include"
         -I"C:\j2sdk1.4.2_02\include\win32"
         -o InterfaceAvecC.o TestJNI2.c
$ gcc -shared -o InterfaceAvecC.dll InterfaceAvecC.c InterfaceAvecC.c InterfaceAvecC.def
```

#### For solaris
```
$ cc -G -I/opt/JAVA/jdk1.5.0_01/include -I/opt/JAVA/jdk1.5.0_01/include/solaris InterfaceAvecC.c
     -o libInterfaceAvecC.so
```
     
__!__ of course the java paths will vary depending on your installation

```javascript
static {
  System.load("absolute/library/path");
}
```

* To test and/or execute you must be in the project root.
* To test the modules type: `make TESTMODULE`
* To test the units type: `make TESTUNITAIRE`
* To test the Artificial Intelligence (game against the computer): `make TESTIA`
__(attention: the AI mode does not test if a move is illegal or not)__
* To play the game against a human: `make JAVA`
